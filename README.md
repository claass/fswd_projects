Working folder for Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer Nano Degree]('https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004').
I've completed this online degree back in 2016 but hadn't come around updating
my GitHub profile. **Each project needs a thorough overhaul and some code cleanup.**


## Project included:
1. **Basic Blog** - Creating a basic blog on Google App Engine utilizing Flask.
    Also dabbles with (fairly unsafe) account creation and warehousing.
2. **Neighborhood Map** - Getting familiar with AJAX by putting my favorite bakeries in SF
    on a map via Google Map's API and some simple JavaSCript.
3. **Linux Config** - Intro to AWS by setting up an instance and securing access through SSH
