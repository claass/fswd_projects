# fswd_projects

Working folder for Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer Nano Degree]('https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004').
I've completed this online degree back in 2016 but hadn't come around updating
my GitHub profile. **Each project needs a thorough overhaul and some code cleanup.**


## Project included:
1. Basic Blog
  Creating a basic blogging platform on Google App Engine utilizing Flask.
  Also dabbles with (fairly unsafe) account creation.
2. Neighborhood Map
  Getting familiar with AJAX through putting my favorite bakeries in SF on a
  map via Google Map's API and some simple JavaSCript.
3. Linux Config
  Introduction to setting up an instance on AWS and securing access through SSH
